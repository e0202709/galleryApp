# GalleryApp

GalleryApp is a simple react app that is built to allow users to search for images online.

It was cloned from https://github.com/renatognunes/react-gallery-app, and improvements have been made to the app, such as:

- Added sorting function that allows users to sort based on ascending, descending or default.
- Rewrote components from class to functional
- Made improvements on the code
- Added unit tests using react testing library

Please view the app from here: [App][app].

# Unit tests 
1. Initial page renders correctly with no sorting
2. Without searching, click on 'descending' button
3. Click on 'ascending' sort, and search for a new query, it should display results with no sorting
4. Test on page not found
5. Sorting works as expected


# Improvements to react code/good coding practices
1. UseRef instead of useState in the form, doesnâ€™t cause the component to re-render when updated
2. UseMemo to memoise functions
3. Used functional component instead of class component
4. Added prettier formating and eslint
5. Added unit tests
